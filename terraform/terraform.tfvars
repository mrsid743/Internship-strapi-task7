# --- FINAL FIX: Corrected the typo in both role names ---
ecs_task_execution_role_name = "ec2_ecr_full_access_role"
ecs_task_role_name           = "ec2_ecr_full_access_role"
```

### Just in Case: Verify the "Lock" (The Trust Relationship)

The error also mentions verifying the trust relationship. Let's make sure the "lock" is configured correctly on your IAM role.

1.  In the AWS Console, go to **IAM** -> **Roles**.
2.  Click on the `ec2_ecr_full_access_role` role.
3.  Click on the **"Trust relationships"** tab.
4.  Click **"Edit trust policy"**.

The policy JSON **must** include `ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com`. It should look exactly like this:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
