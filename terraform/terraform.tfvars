# This file provides the specific names of your existing IAM roles.
# The typo with the trailing underscore has been removed.

ecs_task_execution_role_name = "ec2_ecr_full_access_role"
ecs_task_role_name           = "ec2_ecr_full_access_role"
```

### Why This Fixes the Error

The `terraform.tfvars` file is not a script; it's a simple data file. It has a very strict format:

* **Allowed:** `variable_name = "value"`
* **Allowed:** `# This is a comment`
* **Not Allowed:** Any other text, backticks, single quotes for strings, etc.

The corrected file I've provided adheres to this strict format.

### Your Final Steps to a Live Application

1.  **Perform the Cleanup:** Before running the workflow, please make sure you have deleted the leftover resources (Security Groups, Target Group, etc.) from the previous failed runs. This is crucial for a clean start.
2.  **Update the `terraform.tfvars` file:** Replace its content with the corrected code above.
3.  **Commit and Push:**

    ```bash
    git add terraform/terraform.tfvars
    git commit -m "fix(terraform): Correct syntax in tfvars file"
    git push origin main
